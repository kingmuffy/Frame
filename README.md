Overview
In developing my Cottage Retreat web application, I aimed to create an engaging, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing platform for potential guests to learn about our cottage offerings, amenities, and booking options. My primary focus was on ensuring a seamless user experience across various device sizes while providing all the necessary information in an organized and visually appealing manner.

## Key Components

PageHeader Component
The PageHeader component is the first thing users encounter on the site. It's designed to be responsive and visually striking, immediately conveying the essence of the Cottage Retreat. This component includes navigational links and a toggleable menu for mobile views, ensuring that users can easily navigate the site regardless of the device they're using.

# Banner Component

The Banner component serves as the main content area, where users can find detailed information about the cottage, its unique selling points, and high-quality images that showcase the beauty and comfort of the retreat. This section also introduces the 'View Plans' call-to-action button, which, when clicked, opens a modal displaying various accommodation plans.

# Photos Component

This component displays a gallery of images, giving users a visual tour of the cottage and its surroundings. The gallery is responsive, ensuring that users on any device have an optimal viewing experience.

# Faq Component

The Faq section is crucial for providing users with quick answers to common questions. It employs an accordion style for ease of navigation. Users can expand or collapse each FAQ to read the answers. The FAQs are also equipped with a shuffle functionality, offering a dynamic way to view different questions.

Footer Component
The Footer is designed to provide additional navigational links and important information like contact details, privacy policy, and terms & conditions. It's structured to adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring that information is presented clearly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Modal for Viewing Plans

One of the key interactive elements in my application is the modal for viewing accommodation plans. Triggered by the 'View Plans' button in the Test component, this modal provides detailed information about each plan, including pricing and features. It's a crucial component for converting potential guests into actual customers.

## Technologies Used

React.js: For building the user interface.
Tailwind CSS: For styling the components in a mobile-first approach.
Lucide-react: For incorporating various icons, enhancing the visual appeal and user experience.

## Conclusion

My Cottage Retreat web application is designed with the user in mind. Every component, from the header to the footer, works harmoniously to provide a seamless and informative experience. By leveraging modern web technologies and responsive design principles, I have created an application that not only looks good but is also functional and user-friendly.

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

Centering the First Photo in the Photos Component
Current Design: In the current layout of the Photos component, the first image is aligned to the left at 0px, which fits well within the overall design structure. However, this alignment might not fully leverage the visual impact that the image could have on the user experience., the choice of green color for the dropdown could be modified.
